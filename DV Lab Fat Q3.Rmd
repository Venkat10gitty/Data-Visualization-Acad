```{r}
### Question 1 - Use scatter plot and find which of the attributes is most likely to have a positive impact on
quality.
library(car)
data(wine, package='rattle')
attach(wine)
head(wine)
scatterplotMatrix(wine[2:6])
```

```{r}
### Question 2 - Use R snippet with tableau to find the sweeter wines (more residual sugar) receive better ratings? Justify with a graph.

TABLEAU 
```

```{r}
### Question 3 - Use R snippet to plot the LDA analysis for suitable attributes to find the density of the wine.

library(MASS)
wine.lda <- lda(Type ~ ., data=wine)
wine.lda

wine.lda.values <- predict(wine.lda)
ldahist(data = wine.lda.values$x[,1], g=Type)

plot(wine.lda.values$x[,1],wine.lda.values$x[,2]) # make a scatterplot
text(wine.lda.values$x[,1],wine.lda.values$x[,2],Type,cex=0.7,pos=4,col="red") # add labels
```
